# **App Name**: CoverLetter Pro

## Core Features:

- Document Type Selection: Choose the type of document: assignment, lab report, or general note.
- Input Fields: Input fields for university name, department, session, course code, teacher name, designation, student name, ID, and submission date.
- Assignment / Lab Report Topic Memory: Allows the user to manually input the topic of an assignment or lab report.  The app stores these locally, so that when 'assignment' or 'lab report' is selected as a document type, these entries will be re-suggested as possible entries to be re-used by the user.
- AI Input Validation: AI-powered tool which reviews all of the input values the user has entered, to check that fields conform to common conventions. Example: confirm date values use a common format, suggest that student ID or course code values have the correct number of characters, suggest edits for excessive title length
- Cover Page Preview: Preview the cover page layout, automatically formatted.  If no university logo is available, it is replaced with a generic placeholder image.
- PDF Export: Generates the cover page in PDF format.
